## Compiler
Compiler runs in three phases
1. front end
	- translate the source code to a largely language independent intermediate representation
	- gcc tranforms all of its input language into two languages called GIMPLE and GENERIC
	- think of GIMPLE and GENERIC as abstract syntax tree.
2. middle end: compiler optimizes your code, look for ways to make it run faster
3. back end: translate the intermediate language into the assembly language of the computer that will run the program

## Compiler Toolchain
![[Pasted image 20231021180634.png]]
### 1. Compile to assembly code
```shell
> gcc -S hello.c
```
- The result `hello.s` is in assembly. 
- assembly code is a human readable language that represents the instructions that a computer actually runs

### 2. Assemble the assembly code into the object code
- assembler: assemble the assebly code into the object code
- invoke the assembler with the command  `as` 
	```shell
	> as hello.s -o hello.o
	```
- the output isn't human readable any more, it's an object file that contains machine code instructions and data

### 3. Linking
- linker
	- invoked with command `ld`
	- take one or more compiled and assembled object files and combines them to create a file that is an executable format
- the final executable file is a package that contains all of the instructions in the program in addition to a data section -- containing items like constant strings -- and links to dynamic libraries. The libraries contain the object code that implements functions such as printf.
- Note: this executable is not portable. 
	- cannot copy it to another machine and know it will run


### More tools in Compiler Toochain
- loader
	-  The executable needs to be loaded into memory when you execute it.
	-  loader is operating system specific.
- preprocessor
	- prepare the source code for the front end
	- adds function prototypes for library and system calls required by the program and interprets preprocessor directives like macros.
	- every line of a program that starts with a hash `#` has to be cleaned up by the preprocessor.
-  compiler toolchain also includes tools to help with compilation
	- make 
	- debugger



## Header Files
### compiler process for compilation of multiple file

![[Pasted image 20231021191029.png]]
- when multiple files are required, each file is compiled and assembled separately
- then, the object files are combined during the linking stage to produce an executable
- separate compilation
	- advantage: save time in huge projects
		- if we have a very large project with thousands of files, and want to make a small change to a single file
		- instead of recompiling every file in our huge project, we can just recreate the single object file that is affected and re-link
	- disadvantage
		- if we change some type in one of the files, the types are checked for consistency separately. Though they aren't consistent with each other, but the compiler won't check that.
	- But separate compilation is valuable by header files
```shell
>gcc -c compare_sorts.c
>gcc -c sorts.c
>ls *.o
>compare_sorts.o sorts.o
>gcc compare_sorts.o sorts.o
```

### Header Files
- a header should declare what functions do and what types they require, without defining how they are actually implemented. 
- `#include "sorts.h"`
	- use quotes, to tell the compiler that it should use the header file in my current directory, rather than a header file in the system library. 
- we don't supply the name of the header file to gcc, The #include statement tells the preprocessor to insert the body of the header file into the source code before the compiling even begins.

### Header File Variables
- `extern`: stands for externally defined
- By default, symbol names in C are externally visible, that is, they are available globally, everywhere in a program.
- `static`
	1. used to denote that a global variable cannot be visible outside the file where it is defined
		- static makes a symbol name local
		- it becomes available only in the file that defined it.
	2. used in the definition of a local variable
		- It means that the variable should keep its value across function executions.
		```C
		#include <stdio.h>
		void function_example(){
			static int x = 3;
			printf("%d\n", x);
			x = x + 2;
		}
		int main(){
			function_example();
			function_example();
			function_example();
			return 0;
		}
		```
		```shell
		>./a.out
		3
		5
		7
		```
		
- guard condition
	- goal: to keep the header file from being included more than once in any compilation. A multiply included header will generate errors.
	```C
	#ifndef SORTS_H
	#define SORTS_H	
	```
	- The first time this header file is encountered, SORTS_H doesn't exist, so the definition is executed. If the header is included again, then the condition will be true, and the contents of the header file will not be processed.
- `#endif`
	- to tell the compiler where the body of the if statement ends. 
	- `endif` provides this information, and to make it easier for a human reader
- dependency
	- The source files rely on the contents of the header file
	- so we have to recompiled when the header file changes.
	- makefiles: for tracking which files need to be recompiled


## Makefiles
### Why we derived Makefiles
-  we encountered a situation where source files had to be recompiled because a header file they included had been edited. Tracking these sorts of dependencies is tricky.
- when a project has many source files and header files, it can be hard to remember which files depend on which other files.
### Make
- `make`: The compiler toolchain provides a tool called "make" to help manage the compilation, or build, process.

```
target: dependencies...
	recipe
```
-  Makefiles are composed of a sequence of rules
	- Each rule has a target: the file to be constructed.
	- And each rule also has a recipe: the command or list of commands to execute that create the target.
	- If dependencies are present, the recipe are executed if one or more of the dependencies are newer than the target.
	-  If there are no dependencies, the actions are only executed if the target doesn't exist.
	- note:
		- The whitespace before the recipe is a *tab*, not just spaces.
-  example
```
compare_sorts: compare_sorts.c sorts.c
	gcc compare_sorts.c sorts.c -o compare_sorts
```
-  explanation for example above
	- This rule defines a target named compare_sorts.
	- `compare_sorts` depends on two source files, thus, compare_sorts.c and sorts.c are dependencies of the target compare_sorts
	- recipe in this rule is `gcc compare_sorts.c sorts.c -o compare_sorts`

1. `make`: When I run the command `make` without arguments, it looks for a file named Makefile in the local directory and checks the rules it contains.
2. `touch`: change file timestampes
	- The touch command updates the time that a file has been modified.
```shell
>cat Makefile
compare_sorts: compare_sorts.c sorts.c
	gcc compare_sorts.c sorts.c -o compare_sorts
>make
gcc comapre_sorts.c sorts.c -o comapre_sorts
>make
make: `compare_sorts` is up to date.
>touch sorts.c
>make
gcc comapre_sorts.c sorts.c -o comapre_sorts
```
3. but the rule doesn't yet account for the header file; also, never take advantage of separate compilation with this make file rule
```C
compare_sorts.o: compare_sorts.c sorts.h
	gcc -c compare_sorts.c -o compare_sorts.o
sorts.o: sorts.c sorts.h
	gcc -c sorts.c -o sorts.o
compare_sorts: compare_sorts.o sorts.o
	gcc compare_sorts.o sorts.o -o compare_sorts
```

4. Note:
	- when run `make` with no arguments, `make` evaluated the first rule in the file
	- if we use a command-line argument to specify a particular target then it will evaluate that rule.
	- each time make evaluates a rule, it will first check all the dependencies, and if a dependency is also a target in the makefile, it will evaluate that rule first before checking the dependencies.
``` shell
>rm *.o
>make
gcc -c compare_sorts.c -o compare_sorts.o
>make compare_sorts
gcc compare_sorts.o sorts.o -o compare_sorts
>touch compare_sorts.c
>make compare_sorts
gcc -c compare_sorts.c -o compare_sorts.o
gcc compare_sorts.o sorts.o -o compare_sorts
```

### wildcard
```C
%.o: %.c sorts.h
	gcc -c $< -o $@

compare_sorts: compare_sorts.o sorts.o
	gcc compare_sorts.o sorts.o -o compare_sorts
```

- `%` means that each object file that needs to be built depends on a source file of the same name.
- `$<` is a variable containing the first name in the list of dependencies.
- `$@` is a variable containing the name of the target.
- `.PHONY`: indicates that clean isn't actually a file. It's just a legal target.
```C
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm compare_sorts *.o
```
- makefiles can include varialbes
```C
OBJFILES = compare_sorts.o sorts.o
%.o: %.c sorts.h
	gcc -c $< -o $@

compare_sorts: $(OBJFILES)
	gcc $(OBJFILES) -o compare_sorts
```

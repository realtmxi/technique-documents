## Open File function

```C
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode)
```
- Mode string:
	- "r": file opened for reading
	- "w": file opened for writing
	- "a": file opened for appending
- checking error
```
FILE *file;
file = fopen("file_name.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL){
	fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file\n");
	return 1;
} 
```
## Close File function
``` c
int fclose(FILE *stream)
```
- checking error
```
error = fclose(file);
if (error != 0){
	fprintf(stderr, "fclose failed\n");
	return 1;
}
```
## Reading from files
### `fgets` function
```
char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream)
```

- `FILE *stream`: the source of the data, where fgets acquires its input. We could use stdin to get input from standard input rather than a file.
- `char *s`: a pointer to memory where text can be stored
	return s, if success;  fgets signals an error by returning NULL.
- `int n`: the maximum number of characters that fgets is allowed to put in s, including a null character at the end of the string.
#### Example 
``` C
#include <stdio.h>

#define LINE_LENGTH 80

/* Reads and prints the contents of a file (top10.txt). */
int main() {
    FILE *scores_file;
    int error;
    char line[LINE_LENGTH + 1];  // +1 for the null-terminator
  
    scores_file = fopen("top10.txt", "r");

    // Check if scores_file was opened properly:
    if (scores_file == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // If fgets fails to read any characters, it returns NULL.
    // We can use this fact to tell if we've reached the end
    // of the file:
    while (fgets(line, LINE_LENGTH + 1, scores_file) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);
    }
  
    error = fclose(scores_file);
    if (error != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fclose failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

read from stdin example
``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#define LINE_LENGTH 80

int main() {
	char line[LINE_LENGTH + 1];
	while (fgets(line, LINE_LENGTH + 1, stdin) != NULL) {
		fprintf("You typed: %s, line");
	}
	return 0;
}
```


### `scanf` function
```
int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)
```
- return the number of items successfully read, the number of items will be equal to the number of format specifiers
- `FILE *stream` giving the stream from which to read
- example
``` C
	#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *scores_file;
    int error, total;
    char name[81];
  
    scores_file = fopen("top10.txt", "r");
    if (scores_file == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file\n");
        return 1;
    }
  
    // Like scanf, fscanf returns the number of items successfully
    // read.
    // Here we compare the return value of fscanf to 2, since we
    // expect it to find two things on each call: a string
    // and an integer.
    while (fscanf(scores_file, "%80s %d", name, &total) == 2) {
        printf("Name: %s. Score: %d.\n", name, total);
    }
  
    error = fclose(scores_file);
    if (error != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fclose failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


## Writing to files
```
output_file = fopen("myfile.txt", "w")
```
Whenever we intend to write into a file, then we must use 'w' or 'a' as the mode when calling `fopen`
```
fprintf(output_file, "The integer is %d\n", total);
```
`fprintf` uses the same format specifiers as `printf`, except that each call includes the output_file stream as the first argument.  [[1. printf and scanf format codes]]


### Why we don't recommend I/O debugging
When program writes to a stream, it's actually writing to a location in memory controlled by the os. That memory is periodically written to the file on disk. If the program crashes or terminates abnormally, `fprintf` and `printf` --statements that were executed may not actually be written to disk or to the screen. This could lead you to look for the bug far earlier in your program. Hence, learn to use gdb is important.

## Definition
1. protocol: Each machine has an internet protocol, or IP address: an address that can be used to send a message to it from any other machine that is connected to the internet.
2. ports: 
	- messages sent across the internet are destined for a particular program. so we need more than just the machine to specify which program, that is what ports for.
	- If a machine's address is like a street address, then a port is like an apartment number in the building at that address.
3. packets: messages sent from one machine are enclosed in packets. you can think of them as packages. They contain both the address and a payload -- the contents of the packet.
4. router: 
	- when the packet leaves the machine, it is received by another device, called **router**, that facilitates transfer of packets between networks.
	- Routers are connected to multiple networks and know which network the packet should be sent to in order to get it closer to its final destination.
5. server: a server is a program running on a specific port of a certain machine waiting for another program (or maybe many other program) to send a message.
	- many common services have defined ports:
		- web pages are typically served on port 80
		- secure web pages use port 443
6. client: A user runs a client program when they want to start interacting with a server. The client program sends the initial message
7. sockets: we use sockets to establish a communication channel
	- there are a few different types of sockets, and they different types all rely on the same system calls.
	- stream socket: build on the TCP protocol.
		- connection-oriented
		- no loss guaranteed
		- in-order delivery
	- datagram socket
	- domain socket
## socket system call
```C
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
1. endpoint:
	- This system call is used to create an endpoint for communication. 
	- When we ultimately get everything set up, we will need one endpoint in the client program and one endpoint in the server. 
	- So both programs will independently invoke this system call.
2. the return value is type int. 
	- It will be -1 if there is an error
	- on success, it will be the index of an entry in the file-descriptor table
3. the first parameter domain:
	- domain set the protocol (or set of rules) used for communication
	- you can either set it to be the defined constant `PF_INET` or `AF_INET`
	- historically, these two constants are defined the same in socket.h
4. the second parameter type:
	- in this case, we will set it `SOCK_STREAM`
5. the third parameter protocol:
	- the parameter configures which protocol the socket will use for communication
	- stream sockets use the TCP protocol
	- in this case, we could set third parameter to be 0 (which tells the socket system call to use the default protocol for this type of socket)


## Socket Configuration
we could set up an endpoint for communication between two processes by using the socket system call to create a stream socket. Now we will configure that socket to wait for connections at a specific address.
### bind system call
```C
int listen_soc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if ((listen_soc) == -1) {
	perror("socket");
	exit(1);
}
```

```
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);
```
- the first parameter is the socket that we want to configure 
- the second parameter, address, is of type pointer to struct sockaddr
	- for our particular family `AF_INET`, we will set this by using a struct `sockaddr_in`
- the last parameter to bind is the length of the address that we are passing. so we get this by using sizeof on struct `sockaddr_in`
- error checking
	- bind returns 0 on success and -1 on failure
	- Confirming the success of bind is particularly important;
		- Suppose the port you picked is not available because it is already in use. 
		- Bind will fail and you wouldn't want your program to continue running without alerting you if this happened.

### struct `sockaddr_in`
```C
struct sockaddr_in{
	short sin_family;
	u_short sin_port;
	struct in_addr sin_addr;
	char sin_zerop[8];
}
```

for our particular family `AF_INET`, we set it as below
```C
struct sockaddr_in addr;
addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
addr.sin_port = htons(54321);
addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
memset(&(addr.sin_zero), 0, 8);
```
#### the first field
for the first field, we use `AF_INET` to be consistent with our socket

#### the second field
- the second field, `sin_port` is where we set the port number
##### port number
- port numbers range from 0 to 65535
- well-know ports: for the lowest 1024, 0 - 1023 are reserved for well-known ports.
- registered ports: the range of ports from 1024 - 49,151, are called **registered ports**
	- if you use these ports for a service you wish to make public, you can register with IANA (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- dynamic ports: the range of ports from 49,152 to 65,535 are called dynamic ports.

##### function `htons`
- suppose your instructor told you to use port 54321 for a course project
- htons stands for host-to-network-short
- htons converts byte order of host machine to network byte order

#### the third field
- the only field of this inside struct that we need to set is `s_addr`, we can set it to the predefined constant `INADDR_ANY`
- This configures the socket to accept connections from any of the addresses of the machine

##### Note
a machine can have multiple network interface cards and can be plugged into separate networks. It would have a different IP on each network.

#### the last field
- the last field `sin_zero` is extra padding, this makes the `sockadd_in` struct the same length as the `sockaddr` struct
- when we malloc the space for this struct, those bytes are not reset, they hold the values that were there in memory before the malloc call.
- since we are going to be sending these bytes over the internet, so we use the function `memset` to set these 8 bytes to zero.
  ``` C
  |sin_family|sin_port|in_addr|sin_addr|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
  ```


#### the second parameter in bind
Now that we have our `addr` struct initialized, we are ready to pass it as the second
parameter to bind. But bind is expecting a pointer to struct `sockaddr` not a struct `sockaddr_in`
Thus,
1. we need to take the address of our struct
2. we need to cast this to struct `sockadd *`
```C
int bind(listen_soc, (struct sockadd *) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
```


### listen system call
So now we have socket bound to a particular port on a particular machine. Next, we need to tell the machine to start looking for connection. We use listen system call to accomplish this.
```C
int listen(int socket, int backlog);
```
- the first parameter is the same socket we are setting up.
- the second parameter `backlog`
	- max number of partial connections the server can hold

### example code
```C
int main(){
// create socket
int listen_soc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STEAM, 0);
if (listen_soc == -1){
	perror("socket");
	exit(1);
}

// initialize server address
struct sockaddr_in server;
server.sin_family = AF_INET;
server.sin_port = htons(54321);
server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
memset(&server.sin_zero, 0, 8);

// bind socket to an address
if (bind(listen_soc, (struct sockaddr *) &server, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)) == -1){
	perror("server: bind");
	close(listen_soc);
	exit(1);
}


// set up a queue in the kernel to hold pending connections
if (listen(listen_soc, 5) < 0){
	perror("listen");
	exit(1);
}

struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
unsigned int client_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
client_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;

int return_value = accept(listen_soc, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_len);

return 0;
}
```

## Setting Up a Connection

### accept 
Now, we'll look at how a server accepts connections from a client
```C
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t *addrlen);
```
The accept system call takes three parameters:
1. the first of which is the listening socket that we have been setting up and configuring.
2. The second parameter address is of type pointer to struct `sockaddr`.
	- accept uses this parameter to communicate back to the caller, the address of the client, the machine that is attempting to connect
	- When accept returns, the second parameter will point to a struct that holds the client's address information.
	- Note that, if you call accept and no client is attempting to connect, accept will not return immediately. It will block.
3. the third parameter is a pointer to memory that holds the address length.
4. the return value of accept
	- accept returns -1 when accept fails, and we use it in error checking
	- but on success, It's an integer representing a new socket which we will use to communicate with the client.

``` C
struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
client_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
unsighed int client_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);

int return_value = accept(listen_soc, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &client_len);
```

### write a client program that will connect
1. Just like we did in the server, we need to create a stream socket that will use TCP to communicate over the internet.
#### connect
```C
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t addrlen);
```
we use the connect system call to initiate a connection over the socket to the server
- the first parameter is the socket that we just created.
- The second parameter is the address of the socket on the server to which we want
to connect.

##### system call `getaddrinfo`
```C
int getaddrinfo(char *host, char *service, struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **result);
```
we use a system call, `getaddrinfo` to look up the internet address of a machine based on its name.
- the first parameter is a string, which is the name of the host machine
- The last parameter is the address of a pointer to a linked-list of structs.

#### example code
```C
int main(){
	// create socket
	int soc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	if (soc == -1){
		perror("client: socket");
		exit(1);
	}
	
	// initialize server address
	struct sockaddr_in server;
	server.sin_family = AF_INET;
	memset(&server.sin_zero, 0, 8);
	server.sin_port = htons(54321);

	struct addrinfo *ai;
	char *hostname = "teach.cs.toronto.edu";
	
	// this call declare memory and populates ailist
	getaddrinfo(hostname, NULL, NULL, &ai);
	// we only make use of the first element in the list
	server.sin_addr = ((struct sockaddr_in *) ai->ai_addr)->sin_addr;
	// free the memory that was allocated by getaddrinfo for this list
	freeaddrinfo(ai);

	int ret = connect(soc, (struct sockaddr *) &server, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));

	printf("Connect returned %d\n", ret);
	return 0;
}
```

## Communication
the type of socket is int. Once we have the stream socket set up between the server and client, we use this socket descriptor just like we use a file descriptor.

#### network newline
`\r\n` is called a network newline.

#### close socket
It's also a good idea to explicitly add a close when you're done with the socket.
This will cause the connection to be terminated.
```C
soc = socket(...)

close(soc);
```

## Unbuffered I/O
- `strace` trace system calls and signals
- file descriptor:
	- an non-negative integer that represents an open file, or open communication channel
	- file descriptors are of type int because os use them as indexes into a table of open files
	- file descriptor is one field in a FILE struct
	- standard file descriptors
		- 0: standard input
		- 1: standard output
		- 2: standard error

## Pipe
- Pipes are one type of communication mechanism that can be used to send data between related processes.
-  A pipe is specified by an array of two file descriptors, the first element of the array is always for reading data from the pipe, and second one is for writing data to the pipe.
- pipes are uni-directional: one process will write to the pipe and another process will read from the pipe.
	- So the parent can write to the pipe and the child can read from it, OR the child can write to the pipe and the parent can read from it.
	- Once you have decided which direction the data should flow, you need to close the file descriptors that you won't be using.


## Redirecting input and output with dup2
### dup2
- this system call makes a copy of an open file descriptor
- We will use it to reset the stdout file descriptor so that writes to stdout will go to our output file
- we cab redirect standard output using `dup2(filefd, fileno(stdout));`
	- We extract the file descriptor for stdout, a global variable of type FILE pointer, using the fileno function.
### file descriptor table
- each process has its own set of file descriptors, this mean each process has its own file descriptor table.
- This table is stored in the "process control block" and contains pointers to data structures that contain information about open files.
- for example, the 0 index into the file descriptor table usually contains a link to the console.

## Introduction 
- We have been using text files when performing file input or output, but not all files contain text. All files ultimately contain binary data (bytes made up of 8 bits that are either one or zero), but in text files, each of these bytes can be interpreted as a human-readable text. 

- Why would we want to store files in this binary format, rather than a readable text format? 
	- One major reason is that there is often no convenient way of storing something as text. For example, image files like jpg or gif, or music files like wav or mp3, have no obvious text in them. They hold numeric representations of pictures or music. There is no reason to invent some way to display these files as text. 
	- In addition, we may choose to store data in a binary format when the intended consumer is a computer, rather than a human, or if we are concerned about the size of the file, since storing data in binary format typically leads to smaller files than storing it in a text format.

- So, if binary files are smaller and more versatile than text files, why not use binary files for everything? As we have shown, binary files are not directly viewable or editable. In applications where you want humans to view or edit the content, a text format is appropriate.

```C
output_file = fopen("testing.dat", "rb");
```
- To open a binary file, we include a letter b in the mode that we pass to fopen. 
- fgets, fprintf, fscanf -- are not useful for binary files. binary files have no notion of "line". 

## Writing Binary Files
### `fwrite`
```C
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FIEL *stream)
```
- `ptr`: the first parameter is a pointer to the data that we want to write to the file
- `size`: the second parameter is the size of each element that we're writing to the file
- `nmemb`: The third parameter is the number of elements that we are writing to the file.
	- For an individual variable, the third parameter is one. 
	- For an array, it's typically the number of elements in the array.
- `stream`: The final parameter is the file pointer to which we will write.
- `fwrite` returns the number of elements successfully written to the file, or 0 on error.
- example 1
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *data_file;
    int error;
    int number = 512;
    char character = 's';
    float fraction = 4.5;

	data_file = fopen("my_data", "wb");
	if (data_file == NULL){
		fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not open file\n");
		return 1;	
	}
	error = fwrite(&number, sizeof(int), 1, data_file);
	error += fwrite(&character, sizeof(char), 1, data_file);
	error += fwrite(&fraction, sizeof(fraction), 1, data_file);

	if (error != 3){
		fprintf(stderr, "Error: data not fully written to file\n");
	}

	error = fclose(data_file);
	if (error != 0)P
		fprintf(stderr, "Error: fclose failed\n");
		return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- example 2
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *data_file;
    int error;
    int numbers[] = {400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000};
    
    data_file = fopen("array_data", "wb");
    if (data_file == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not open file\n");
        return 1;
    }
  
    error = fwrite(numbers, sizeof(int), 5, data_file);
    if (error != 5) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: array not fully written to file\n");
        return 1;
    }
  
    error = fclose(data_file);
    if (error != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: fclose failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
## Reading Binary Files
```C
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
```
- `void *ptr`: The first parameter is a pointer to the memory where the data from the file will be stored.
- `size_t size`: The second parameter is the size of one element.
- `size_t nmemb`: The third parameter is the number of elements to read.
- `FILE *stream`: Finally, the fourth parameter is the stream to read from.
- `fread` returns the number of elements successfully read from the file. If returns 0, this signals either that an error has occurred or that the end of the file has been reached.
- Notice `fread` takes a non-constant pointer, but `fwrite` takes a constant pointer. Since `fwrite` is writing data from memory to the file, so the memory does not need to be modified. However, `fread` is writing data from the file to memory, so the parameter cannot be const.
- example 1
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
	FILE *data_file;
	int error;

	int number;
	char character;
	float fraction;

	data_file = fopen("my_data", "rb");
	if (data_file == NULL) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not open file\n");
		return 1;
	}
	fread(&number, sizeof(int), 1, data_file);
	fread(&character, sizeof(char), 1, data_file)
	fread(&fraction, sizeof(fraction), 1, data_file);
	printf("Here is what we got from the file: %d, %c, %f\n");
}
```
 Output:
 ```shell
 >gcc -Wall fread1.c
 >./a.out
 >Here is what we got from the file: 512, s, 4.500000
 ```
example 2:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define NUM_ELEMENTS 5

int main() {
    FILE *data_file;
    int error;
    int numbers[NUM_ELEMENTS];
    int i;    
  
    data_file = fopen("array_data", "rb");
    if (data_file == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not open file\n");
        return 1;
    }
  
    fread(numbers, sizeof(int), NUM_ELEMENTS, data_file);
  
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_ELEMENTS; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }
    
    printf("\n");
  
    error = fclose(data_file);
    if (error != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: fclose failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Output:
 ```shell
 >gcc -Wall fread1.c
 >./a.out
 >400 800 1200 1600 2000
 ```
 
- It's not guaranteed to work to use `fwrite` to create a binary file, and then use `fread` on a different computer to read that data back.

## wav Files
- wav file
	- header
		- 44 bytes of data
		- contain information about the wav file, including parameters required to play file in a music program
	- sample
		- after the header comes one or more 2-byte values
		- each two-byte value is called a sample
- od:  print out the value found in a binary file; we could think of od as a file viewer for binary files.
	- `-A d` translate od's output from the default of based 8 to base 10
	- `-j 44` skip the first 44 bytes (header) of the file
	- `-t d2` tell od that the file consists of two byte values
``` shell
od -A d -j 44 -t d2 short.wav
0000044      2      2      2      2      2      8      8      8
0000060      8      8     16     16     16     16     16      4
0000076      4      4      4      4
0000084
```


## Reading and Writing [Structs](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=csc209%2F7.%20Structs)
```C
fwrite(&s, sizeof(struct student), 1, student_file);
```

## Moving around in Files
1. fseek
```C
int fseek(FIEL *stream, long int offset, int whence);
```
- `FILE *stream`: the stream whose position we'd like to change
- `long int offset`: a byte count indicating how much the file position should change
- `int whence`: the third parameter determines how the second parameter is interpreted.

| constant| meaning|
| --- | --- |
| SEEK_SET|from the beginning of the file|
| SEEK_CUR | from current file position|
| SEEK_END | from end of file|

2. to move to the beginning of a file
```C
/* Method1: fseek */
fseek(my_file, 0, SEEK_SET);

/* Method2: rewind */
void rewind(FILE *steam);
```

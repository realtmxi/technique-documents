## pointer
`&`
- `&i`
- the ampersand operator returns the address of the variable i.
`*`
1. `int *pt`: declare pt to be the type "pointer to int"
2. `*pt`: dereferencing a pointer

the size of a pointer is 8 bytes.

## pointer arithmetic
- if `p` contains the address of `a[0]`, `p+i` is the address of `a[i]`, `p+i = &(a[i])`
- `x[y]` is defined as `*((x)+(y))`

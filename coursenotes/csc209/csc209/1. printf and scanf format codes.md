## printf and scanf key letters

The first argument to printf() or scanf() is a format string.
In printf(), most things are output directly except for format codes beginning
with a '%'.
Key letters show data type AND formatting.

The most important key letters are d, g (usually used as "lg"), and s.

| code | type           | format                                                        |
|------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| d    | int            | decimal (base ten) number                                     |
| o    | int            | octal number (no leading '0' supplied in printf)              |
| x or X | int          | hexadecimal number (no leading '0x' supplied in printf; accepted if present in scanf) (for printf, 'X' makes it use upper case for the digits ABCDEF) |
| ld   | long           | decimal number ('l' can be applied to any of the above to change the type from 'int' to 'long') |
| u    | unsigned       | decimal number                                                |
| lu   | unsigned long  | decimal number                                                |
| c    | char [footnote]| single character                                              |
| s    | char pointer   | string                                                        |
| f    | float [footnote]| number with six digits of precision                           |
| g    | float [footnote]| number with up to six digits of precision                     |
| e    | float [footnote]| number with up to six digits of precision, scientific notation|
| lf   | double [footnote]| number with six digits of precision                          |
| lg   | double [footnote]| number with up to six digits of precision                    |
| le   | double [footnote]| number with up to six digits of precision, scientific notation|

*Footnote:* In printf(), the expression type promotions are expected -- in an
expression, char and short are converted to int, and float is converted to
double. Thus %c actually corresponds to a parameter of type int and %f and %g actually correspond to parameters of type double.  Thus in printf() there is no difference between %f and %lf, or between %g and %lg. However, in scanf() what is passed is a _pointer_ to the variable so no type promotions occur or are expected. Thus %f and %lf are quite different in scanf, but the same in printf.

Personally, I used to use %lg routinely for doubles in both printf and scanf, but this is out of favour these days and indeed gcc will give you a warning message for using %lg in printf. The usual procedure these days is to use %g for double in printf and %lg for double in scanf. It doesn't matter which you use for printf because the printf library function treats them as synonymous, but it's crucial to get it right for scanf.

## printf format modifiers

Modifiers appear between the '%' and the key letter.

- a number is a field width
- '.' and a number is a "precision"
    - Example: printf("%6.3f", 2.8) yields `_2.800` (with a space before the '2')
    - Note that that "6" includes the 3 decimal places and the 1 '.' -- 6 characters total.  Thus 6-3-1 = 2 characters to the left of the decimal point.
- 0 (the digit zero) means pad with zeroes to field width (usually used only with integers)
- l (the letter) means "long", e.g. %ld to format a long int in decimal

### Example of '0':

```plaintext
int dollars = 2;
int cents = 3;   /* $2.03 */
printf("  ?? what goes here ??    ", dollars, cents);
```

| If format is | then output is |
|--------------|----------------|
| "$%d.%d"     | $2.3           |
| "$%d.%2d"    | $2. 3          | 
| "$%d.%02d"   | $2.03          |

In "%02d", the 0 is _not_ part of the field width. It is a modifier character. And when you have a field width, you must write it such that it does not start with a zero (and then you can prepend a zero as a modifier character if you want that).

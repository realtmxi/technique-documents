## System Call
A system call is a function that requests a service from the operating system.

1. Exit
```C
void exit(int status);
```
An exit call is a request to the operating system to terminate the program. When exit is called, the operating system executes instructions to clean up the data structures that represent the running process and to terminate the process.
2. The low level I/O calls `read` and `write` are system calls.
3. a system call occurs, control is given to the operating system and the operating system executes code on behalf of the program.
4. On a linux machine, those calls are roughly divided into low-level process management, file management, and interprocess communication calls.
	- File management system calls
		```C
		int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
		ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
		ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
		int close(int fd);
		```
	- Process management system calls
		```C
		pid_t fork(void);
		pid_t getpid(void);
		pid_t wait(int *status);
		int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
		int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);
		```
	- Interprocess communication system calls
		```C
		int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
		int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
		int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
		int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
		int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
		```

## Library Call
- Library call executes several helper functions before calling the write system call.
- Here is an example process on calling `printf`

- library function example
	- `printf`
	- `scanf`
	- `fopen`
	- `fgets`
- Calling a library function such as printf works exactly the same way as calling a function that you wrote.
- Library functions such as printf, scanf, fopen, fgets will call system calls as part of their operation.


## Errors and Errno

- System calls that return an integer will return -1 to indicate that an error occurred.
- System calls that return a pointer will return a value of NULL to indicate that an error occurred.
### Errno

#### Why we derive Errno
We explicitly checked for errors when we call system calls. However, we don't *just* want to know that an error occurred. We also want to know *why* the error occurred so that we can print a sensible error message to the user. The return value itself cannot be used to indicate the error type, so a global variable called errno is used to store the type of the error.

#### Errno
- errno is a global variable of type int. 
- A header file included with your system defines different codes for different types of errors

#### `perror`
```C
void perror(const char *s);
```
- `perror` prints a message to standard error.
- The message includes the argument s followed by a colon and then the error message that corresponds to the current value of errno.

Notice:
- don't use perror as a generic error message reporting function.
- Its real purpose is to display an error message based on the current value of errno.
- For other types of error messages, you should still use fprintf to stderr.

#### Example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 80

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    FILE *fp;
    char s[MAX_LINE_LENGTH + 1];

    if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL) {
        perror("fopen");
        exit(1);
    }

    if (fgets(s, MAX_LINE_LENGTH, fp) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "no line could be read from the file\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("One line from the file: %s", s);

    return 0;
}
```

1. First, we'll add error checking to `fopen`. It makes sense to use `perror`, since fopen will set errno if it fails.
2. we're checking if `fgets` is able to read any data from the file. 
	1. If it can't, that's not an error that will set errno; it simply signals the end of the file.
	2. Hence, we will use fprintf, rather than perror, to explain the error.

Notice:
- We use exit, rather than simply returning, since we want the program to terminate.
- it's a good habit to use exit, since errors you detect in other functions won't terminate the program if you simply return, rather than invoking exit.

## C Strings
- A C string is a character array that has a null character immediately after the final character of text. 
- Inside a C program, we write the null character as `\0`
- We use `%s` as a printf format specifier to print the contents of the string.
## Initialize Strings and String Literals
### Initialize strings
1. The first way is to provide an array initializer with each of the string's characters.
	- Note that, don't forget the null terminator is a character, as well, and be sure to allocate space for it.
``` C
	char text[20] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'};
```
2. The second way to initialize a string variable is to give the characters of the string in double quotes.
``` C
char text[20] = "hello";
```
- It's illegal for the initializer to be longer than the size of the char array
- but it's legal for the array and the initializer to be the same size. This is a common source of bugs. Since there is no room for the null terminator, and the compiler will not add one.
- we can change the contents of string variables
3. C also offers a short-cut for declaring and initializing string variables. You are allowed to omit the array size completely.
```C
char text[] = "hello";
```
- Note that: Once the array is declared it is fixed size.
### Initialize String Literals
A string literal is a string constant that cannot be changed.
```C
/* "hello" is a string literal, text points to the first character of that string. */
char *text = "hello";
```
## C string functions
### size and length
To use C string functions, we must include the string header file in our program. This header file contains function prototypes of all the C string functions.  `#include <string.h>`
#### `sizeof`
- `sizeof()`: give the number of bytes occupied by the array.
- It is compile time operation.
- sizeof is not the way to determine the number of characters in a string.
- example:
``` C
char weekday[10] = "Monday";
printf("Size of string: %lu\n", sizeof(weekday));
return 0;
```
- output
``` shell 
> gcc -Wall string_size.c
> ./a.out
> Size of String: 10
```
#### `strlen`
```C
size_t strlen(const char*s);
```
- strlen returns the number of characters in the string s, not including the null termination character.
- `size_t` is simply an unsigned integer type
### copy strings
#### `strcpy` 
```C
char *strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);
```
- strcpy copies the characters from string s2 into the beginning of array s1.
- s1 isn't required to be a string when strcpy is called, but s2 is required to.
- strcpy is known as an unsafe function.
#### `strncpy`
```C
char * strncpy ( char * s1, const char * s2, int n );
```
- `int n`: n indicates the maximum number of characters that s1 can hold.

Example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s1[5];
    char s2[32] = "University of";

    // This is unsafe because s1 may not have enough space
    // to hold all the characters copied from s2.
    //strcpy(s1, s2);

    // This doesn't necessarily null-terminate s1 if there isn't space.
    strncpy(s1, s2, sizeof(s1));
    // So we explicitly terminate s1 by setting a null-terminator.
    s1[4] = '\0';

    printf("%s\n", s1);
    printf("%s\n", s2);
    return 0;
}
```
### Concatenate Strings
#### `strcat`
```C
char *strcat(char *s1, const char* s2);
```
- strcat is a string function that concatenates strings. strcat adds the character from s2 to the end of string s1.
- unsafe function
#### `strncat`
```C
char *strncat(char *s1, const char *s2, int n);
```
- n parameter indicates the maximum number of characters, not including the null terminator.
- Unlike strncpy, strncat always adds a null terminator to s1.

Example
```C
char s1[30];
    char s2[14] = "University of";
    char s3[15] = " C Programming";
    strcpy(s1, s2);
    strncat(s1, s3, sizeof(s1) - strlen(s1) - 1);
    printf("%s\n", s1);
    return 0;
```

### Searching with strings
#### `strchr`
```C
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
```
- searching for an individual character in a string
- the first parameter is the string to search
- the second parameter is the character to search for in the string
- returns a pointer to the character that was found, or returns NULL if the character was not found

Example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s1[30] = "University of C Programming";
    char *p;

    // find the index of the first 'v'
    p = strchr(s1, 'v');
    if (p == NULL) {
        printf("Character not found\n");
    } else {
        printf("Character found at index %ld\n", p - s1);
    }

    // find the first token (up to the first space)
    p = strchr(s1, ' ');
    if (p != NULL) {
        *p = '\0';
    }
    printf("%s\n", s1);

    return 0;
}
```

#### `strstr`
```C
char * strstr(const char *s1, const char*s2);
```
- search left to right in s1 for the first occurrence of the substring s2. 
- If s2 is found in s1, strstr returns a pointer to the character of s1 that begins the match with s2.

Example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s1[30] = "University of C Programming";
    char *p;
	p = strstr(s1, "sity");
	if (p == NULL){
		printf("substring not found\n");
	} else {
		printf("Substring found starting at index %d\n", p - s1);
	}
    return 0;
}
```

## Introduction to structs

When we need to store a collection of related data items, a structure is a logical choice.

| | array | structure |
|---| --- | ---|
|data of same type| yes | not required|
|declaration| type and number of elements (array[] notation) | types of members (struct keyword)|
|access via ...| index notation | dot notation|

```C
struct student {
	char first_name[20];
	char last_name[20];
	int year;
	float gpa;
};

struct student s;
strcpy(s.first_name, "Jo");
strcpy(s.last_name, "Smith");
s.year = 2;
s.gpa = 3.2;
```

## Using Pointers to Structs in Functions
- For structs, a function does get a copy of struct. Any change that the function makes is only a change to the copy, not the original struct.
- Note that, a function gets a copy of the entire struct, including arrays.
- Hence, we have function operate directly on the original struct by passing a pointer to the struct as parameter.
```C
struct student *p;
p = &s;
(*p).gpa = 3.8; // *p is in parentheses is because dot has higher precedence than star
p->year = 1;
strcpy(p->first_name, "Henrick");
```

## Linked Structures

### Linked list in C
- linked list: a data structure that stores a sequence of items
- node:  a linked list consists of a front pointer and elements, referred to as "nodes"
- In C, nodes are represented using structs.
	- the data that it stores
	- a pointer to the next node in the list
```C
struct node {
	int value;
	struct node *next;
}
```
- typedef
	- give the struct node a new name
	- for convenience, so we don't have to type struct all the time
	 ```C
	 typedef struct node {
		 int value;
		 struct node *next;
	 } Node;
	 ```
### Traversing a list
- Unlike declaring an array, we often create linked list nodes one at at a time, and allocated nodes on the heap
```C
struct node *node_a = malloc(sizeof(struct node));

struct node *node_b = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
node_a->next = node_b; 
```

```C
Node *create_node(int num, Node *next){
	Node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(Node));
	new_node->value = num;
	new_node->next = next;

	return new_node;
}

int main(){
	Node *front = NULL;

	front = create_node(3, front);
	front = create_node(2, front);
	front = create_node(1, front); 

	Node *curr = front;
	while (curr != NULL) {
		printf("%d\n", curr->value);
		curr = curr->next;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
```shell
> gcc -Wall traverse.c
> ./a.out
1
2
3
```

### Insertion
- to insert a node into a linked list
	- first, we create a new node to be added
	- second, we'll add it to the list by modifying pointers in the correct order

```C
int insert(int num, Node **front_ptr, int position) {
	Node *curr = *front_ptr;

	if (position == 0) {
		*front_ptr = create_node(num, front);
		return 0;
	}
	
	for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && curr != NULL; i++){
		curr = curr->next;
	}
	
	if (curr = NULL) {
		return -1;
	}

	Node *new_node = create_node(num, curr->next);
	curr->next = new_node;
	
	return 0;
}

int main(){
	Node *front;

	front = create_node(4, front);
	front = create_node(3, front);
	front = create_node(1, front); 

	insert(2, &front, 1);
	insert(5, &front, 4);       // insert at end
	insert(9000, &front, 9000); // insert at invalid index
	insert(0, &front, 0);       // insert at the front

	Node *curr = front;
	while (curr != NULL){
		printf("%d\n", curr->value);
		curr = curr->next;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
```shell
> gcc -Wall insert.c
> ./a.out
0
1
2
3
4
5
>
```

- testing insertion cases:
	- middle
	- beginning
	- end
	- illegal index

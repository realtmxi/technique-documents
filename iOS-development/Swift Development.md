- `let`: make a constant
- `var`: make a variable
- a constant or variable must have the same type as the value you assign it, but you don't have to write the type explicitly
- include value in strings
	- explicitly make an instance of the desired type
	- simpler way: write the value in paratheses, and write a backslash(\) before it
``` swift
let apples = 3
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
```
- use three double quotation marks `(""")` for strings take up multiple lines

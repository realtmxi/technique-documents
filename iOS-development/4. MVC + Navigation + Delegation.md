## MVC

A software design pattern which is a set of rules that govern the architecture that we follow when writing our code.

### Model
- Models are objects that represent our application's data
- They contain info about our application and are often updated based on user interaction or from a backend service.
- We will typically use structs when defining our data models.

### Classes vs Structs
- structs are value types. Classes are reference types.
	- if we were to change a property of an instance of a struct, the entire instance changes; On the other hand, if we change a property of an instance of a class, the instance does not change.
- classes support inheritance
- sometimes we don't need all of the properties or methods inherited, use structs

### View
- Views are the visible components that are used to build the UI
- This includes buttons, labels ,images, etc

### Controller
- controller establish a connection between models and views
- Views and models do not interfere with each other, they must go through controller
- In UIKit, a UIViewController is a controller.

## Navigation
- Each screen is represented by a UIViewController
- we can create multiple screens (ViewControllers) and navigate between them.
- There are two main ways:
	- pushing/popping
		- each view controller is pushed onto/popped out of a navigation stack
		- we represent the stack with a `UINavigationController`
		- this is usually created inside of `SceneDelegate.swift`
	- presenting/dismissing
### Navigation stack
To represent the navigation stack in UIKit, inside of `SceneDeledate.swift` add this code to the function `scene`
```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    // 1. Capture the scene
    guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
    
    // 2. Create a new UIWindow and pass in a UIWindowScene
    let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
    
    // 3. Create a view hierarchy programmatically
    let rootVC = ViewController()
    let navController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: rootVC)
    
    // 4. Set the navigation controller as the window's root view controller
    window.rootViewController = navController
    
    // 5. Set the window and call makeKeyAndVisible()
    self.window = window
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
}
```

### push and pop a view controller

-  `UIViewController` will be the view controller object that we want to push.
-  Most of time, we want to set `animated` to `true`

```swift
// Push
navigationController?.pushViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool)

// Pop
navigationController?.popViewController(animated: Bool)
```


### Presenting/Dismissing
- presenting: a model sheet is presented from the bottom of the screen and gradually transitions up.
- dismiss
	- click on the cancel button 
	- or more commonly, swipe downwards from the top of modal sheet
- There is not a navigation stack => No `UINavigationController`
- to present/dismiss a view controller
	- completion handler: an optional parameter, which is a function that gets executed when the function call is complete.
```swift
// Presenting
present(_ viewControllerToPresent: UIViewController, animated: Bool, completion: (() -> Void)?)

// Dismissing
dismiss(animated: Bool, completion: (() -> Void)?)
```


## Delegation
- The main purpose of the delegate pattern is to allow a child ViewController to communicate with its parent without the child knowing its parent's type.
### Protocols
To implement delegation is Swift, we use protocols.
- protocols are a set of properties and methods that classes must implement when conforming to it (similar to interfaces in Java)
- we typically create extensions of our classes to make our code more neat
- It's convention to name our protocol with its purpose followed by the word `Delegate` at the end

```swift
// Create a protocol
protocol UpdateTextDelegate: AnyObject {
	func updateText(newText: String)									
}

// Create an extension (delegate)
extension ParentViewController: UpdateTextDelegate {
	func updateText(newText: String) {
		// Update some text given `newText`
	}												
}

// Delegator
class ChildViewController: UIViewController {
	// Create a property to reference the delegate
	weak var updateTextDelegate: UpdateTextDelegate?										 
}
```

### Delegate vs Delegator
#### delegate
- In the code above, we conformed `ParentViewController` to the `UpdateTextDelegate` protocol.
- The class `ParentViewController` is known as the delegate.
- The delegate is the class that conforms to that protocol.
#### delegator
- if we had a view controller called `ChildViewController` that wants to communicate back with the parent, then this view controller is know as the delegator.
- The delegator is the class that wants the delegate to do something by calling the delegate

To make child class know who the delegate is, the parent class would need to specify that it itself is the delegate:
```swift
// Assume this class conforms to `UpdateTextDelegate`
class ParentViewController: UIViewController {
    // Class definition here

    // When we create an instance to `ChildViewController`, pass in
    // `self` as the delegate
    
    private func pushChildVC() {
        let childVC = ChildViewController()
        childVC.updateTextDelegate = self
        navigationController?.pushViewController(childVC, animated: true)

        // If the property `updateTextDelegate` is private, we will need
        // an initializer in `ChildViewController` that initializes it
	// and use this line instead
        let childVC = ChildViewController(updateTextDelegate: self)
    }
}
```

Once the child has a reference to its parent, we can call that function
```swift
class ChildViewController: UIViewController {
	// Class defintion here

	// Create the property
	// If we make this private, an initializer is required
	weak var updateTextDelegate: UpdateTextDelegate?

	// Communicate with parent
	private func communicateBack() {
		let newString = "Here you go parent"
	updateTextDelegate.updateText(newText: newString)
	}
}
```

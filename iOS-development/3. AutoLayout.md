- A constraint-based organization system, allowing for adaptive UI which adapts to screens of different sizes and orientations.
- Use a relational layout structure to organize views with respect to one another. -> Less error-prone.

## Terminology
- Superview: the immediate ancestor of the current view. 
- Subview: the children of the current view.
- Constraint: In general, constraints must define both the size and the position of a view, in order for that view to display properly within its superview.
- Anchors: Every UIView has a set of anchors that define its layout rules. The most important ones are: widthAnchor, heightAnchor, leadingAnchor, trailingAnchor, topAnchor, bottomAnchor, centerXAnchor and centerYAnchor.

## NSLayout and Setting Constraints
- Before setting up anchors and constraints, the view needs to be added to the base view of the NavigationController, or any superview. `superview.addSubview(currentView)`
- Every subview of UIView has four properties:
	- topAnchor
	- leadingAnchor
	- bottomAnchor
	- trailingAnchor: refer to the view's right edge
- to use these anchors to create constraints(layout or views), we must set `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` before setting these anchors.
```swift
let labelA = UILabel()

override func viewDidLoad() {
	super.viewDidLoad()

	labelA.translatesAutoresizingMastIntoConstraints = false

	// we need to add labelA to the base view of the Navigation Controller
	view.addSubview(labelA)

	// we have to activate our constraints
	NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
		labelA.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor, constraint: 50)
		labelA.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTO: view.centerXAnchor)
	])
}
```

## Clients and Servers
- A client is a device or software that requests a service
- A server is a device or software that responds to clients with these services.

### HTTP request
- an HTTP request is a method used to communicate between a client and a server
- common request type are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- a client sends a request and a server responds with a status code
	- range from 1XX to 5XX
	- 2XX = Good
	- 4XX/5XX = Bad

## Callbacks
### Network Calls
- open instagram or any social media app, the app does not freeze while it fetches for information from a server.
- These network calls happen asynchronously
- we use callbacks so that we would be notified when the request is complete

### Callbacks
- a callback is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and is called after the original function completes
- In Swift, these callback functions are known as completion handlers
- `@escaping`: so that the callback function can outlive the original function
```Swift
func fetchFeed(completion: @escaping ([Post]) -> Void) {
	var posts: [Post] // The list of posts
	// 1. Send a request to the backend (ex: GET request)
	// 2. Handle the backend response (error handling, decode JSON data)
	// 3. Assign the variable `posts` with the decoded data
	completion(posts) // 4. Give the callback function the list of posts
}
```

## Codable
- there are two protocols that your model structs/classes must conform to in order to be decoded: `Decodable` and `Encodable`
- However, we commonly use the protocol `Codable` instead which essentially means that we are conforming to both protocols.

### Alarmofire
- Alamofire is an HTTP(s) networking library written in Swift
- It is build on top of URLSession, but is a lot simpler to use.
- Common use cases include:
	- Fetching a JSON from an API
	- Post some data to and endpoint
	- Download an image from a URL
	- Authentication with a REST API

### NetworkManager
- Create a class to store our backend API calls

```Swift
import Alamofire

class NetworkManager {
	// Shared singleton instance
	static let shared = NetworkManager()
	// Prevent other instances from being created
	private init() {}
}
```
